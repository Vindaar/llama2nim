* llama2nim

This is a simple port of Andrej Karpathy's llama2.c:

https://github.com/karpathy/llama2.c

The idea is to keep the no dependency idea alive. However, I use
~cligen~ for argument parsing and because it's available its
memfile interface (the latter could be replace by ~std/memfiles~, but
initially I thought about using more features)

Example compile: (see README of the original for more details)
#+begin_src sh
nim c -d:danger llama2nim.nim
#+end_src

It needs a checkpoint file, see the README of the original.

Just run the program with
#+begin_src sh
./llama2nim -c <path to checkpoint>
#+end_src
and you can adjust the number of steps as well as the temperature.

** Why?

Because I thought it would be a fun thing to do during a train ride &
waiting at the airport. :)

** Implementation differences

I wrap the raw pointers in a ~Buf[T]~ object for slightly saner
handling of the data incl. freeing of the memory.
